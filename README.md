Here is my project to manage the database from the HR of my firm.
The application can be run with python in a little application developed by myself with tkinter.
Or in flask with html/css.

To run this project successfully you need to copy / paste the following command in your command prompt.

cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/Gaspard2005/Cardpressodb
cd C:\Cardpressodb
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can choose beetween the python or flask version :
Python :
python cardpresso.py

Flask :
cd flask_app
python flaskapp.py
